# Automation your workflow with GitHub Actions

## Overview 

Github Action is a powerful and flexible automation platform that allows developers to automate tasks directly from their repositories. This automation helps you to streamline development, reduce manual errors and increase the efficiency of your software development workflow. With GitHub Actions, you can easily create continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to build, test, and deploy code on every pull request and deploy merged pull request to production. 

## Advantages of GitHub actions

* Managed Infrastructure - Github manages the infrastructure for you which includes setting up servers, scaling resources and managing environments for the workflows.
* YAML-based configuration - Your task is to write workflow configurations in yaml file.
* Automatic execution - Github actions handles rest of the task like executing the task within Virtual Machine, caching necessary dependencies and providing reports on outcomes.
